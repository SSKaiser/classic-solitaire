If it's your first time running the game, run setup.exe first. It doesnt install the program, it simply writes registry keys so that the console sets the righ

This game is a recreation of Solitaire from IBM on DOS (1986)

There are no display modes like in the original version, it is based on the 3270 PC display mode with default color settings


### Running the program

It is meant to run in the default **Windows Console Host**. If your main terminal is Windows Terminal, run the **sol.exe** as administrator

It can run on other consoles but it will look bad unless you resize it to fit the program
